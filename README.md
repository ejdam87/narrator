# Narrator
This is an implementation of narrator program for famous quote citation. It reads one quote from the collection of quotes. I personally use it in a way that it is run at the computer startup automatically. This way, everytime, you turn on your computer, one motivational quote is read for you.

## Dependencies
For the text-to-speech conversion, I use [pyttsx3](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/) package.

## Usage
The intended way to use it is to put `vbs_runner.vbs` into the directory containing all the programs that should be run after the startup.
